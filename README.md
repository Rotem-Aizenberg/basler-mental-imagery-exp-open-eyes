# LSI Visual Mental Imagery Experiment (Open-Eyes Variant)

A research-grade experiment application for studying **Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI)** responses during visual mental imagery tasks with **eyes open**. The system presents geometric shapes with a red fixation cross, synchronized audio cues, records high-speed video of a subject's tissue via a Basler industrial camera, and manages multi-participant sessions with full data logging.

> **Note:** This is the **open-eyes variant**. The participant keeps their eyes open throughout the experiment, fixating on a small red cross at the center of the screen. For the closed-eyes variant, see [basler-mental-imagery-exp](https://github.com/Rotem-Aizenberg/basler-mental-imagery-exp).

Built with **PyQt5** (operator GUI), **PsychoPy** (frame-accurate stimulus/audio), and **pypylon/OpenCV** (camera acquisition).

## Overview

The experiment measures cerebral hemodynamic responses during mental imagery using LSCI. Participants undergo a structured protocol where they:

1. **Learn** a visual shape through repeated visual + auditory presentation (training phase) — a red fixation cross is always visible at the center of the screen and at the center of each shape
2. **Imagine** the shape with eyes open, fixating on the red cross, while audio cues mark recording intervals (measurement phase)

A high-speed Basler camera captures tissue perfusion data during the measurement phase. The operator controls the session through a dedicated GUI window, separate from the participant's fullscreen stimulus display.

---

## Experiment Protocol

Each shape trial follows this sequence:

| Phase | Description | Display | Audio | Camera |
|-------|-------------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Training** | Shape shown N times with synchronized beep | White shape + red fixation cross | 440 Hz tone (vsync-synced) | Preview only |
| **Training blank** | Gap between shape flashes | Red fixation cross on black | Silence | Preview only |
| **Be ready instruction** | MP3: *"Be ready to imagine the shape"* | Red fixation cross on black | MP3 playback | Preview only |
| **5-second wait** | Participant prepares | Red fixation cross on black | Silence | Preview only |
| **Starting instruction** | MP3: *"Starting"* | Red fixation cross on black | MP3 playback | Preview only |
| **2-second wait** | Final preparation | Red fixation cross on black | Silence | Preview only |
| **Measurement** | N beep cycles with silence gaps | Red fixation cross on black | 440 Hz tone | **Recording** |
| **Post-measurement** | Context-dependent MP3 instruction | Red fixation cross on black | MP3 playback | Stopped |

**Post-measurement instructions:**
- More shapes remaining in this turn: *"We are moving on to the next shape"* (5s delay before next shape)
- Last shape, more participants/reps remain: *"Next participant please"*
- Last shape of entire session: *"We have successfully completed the experiment"*

**Recording timing:** Camera starts recording at the onset of the first measurement beep and stops after a silence period (`measurement_silence_duration`) following the last beep offset, plus a 1-second margin.

## System Requirements

### Hardware
- **Camera:** Basler acA1440-220um USB3 (or compatible Basler USB3 camera)
- **USB:** USB 3.0 port (required for camera bandwidth)
- **Display:** Dual monitor setup recommended (operator + participant)
- **Audio:** Speakers or headphones for audio cue playback

### Software
- **OS:** Windows 10/11
- **Python:** 3.11.x (PsychoPy requires Python < 3.12)
- **Basler Pylon SDK:** Must be installed system-wide before pypylon ([download](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/downloads/software-downloads/))

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11.x** --- PsychoPy requires Python < 3.12. Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or via `winget install Python.Python.3.11`
- **Basler Pylon SDK** --- Required for Lab Mode only; not needed for Dev Mode. Download from [baslerweb.com](https://www.baslerweb.com/en/downloads/software-downloads/)

### 2. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rotem-Aizenberg/basler-mental-imagery-exp-open-eyes.git
cd basler-mental-imagery-exp-open-eyes
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Camera (Lab Mode only)

```bash
python -c "from pypylon import pylon; tl=pylon.TlFactory.GetInstance(); print([d.GetModelName() for d in tl.EnumerateDevices()])"
```

This should print your Basler camera model name. Ensure the camera is connected to a USB 3.0 port and not in use by another application (e.g., Pylon Viewer).

---

## Usage

### Launch

```bash
# Standard launch (opens wizard)
python main.py

# Pre-select Dev Mode (webcam fallback, no Basler needed)
python main.py --dev-mode

# Use a custom configuration file
python main.py --config path/to/config.json
```

### Wizard Flow

On launch, a 5-step wizard guides the operator through setup:

1. **Mode Selection** --- Lab Mode (Basler camera) or Dev Mode (webcam fallback)
2. **Experiment Settings** --- Shapes, repetitions, timing parameters, output folder
3. **Camera Setup** --- Live preview, resolution, exposure, gain, frame rate
4. **Display & Audio** --- Select participant screen, select audio output device
5. **Subjects** --- Add participant names (supports loading from previous sessions)

### Operator Window

After the wizard, the main operator window displays:

- **Left panel:** Session queue showing all participant turns
- **Center panel:** Control buttons (Start / Pause / Resume / Stop), progress bars, and a stimulus mirror showing what the participant sees
- **Right panel:** Live camera preview

### Controls

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Start** | Begin the experiment session |
| **Pause** | Immediately interrupt the current trial; recording is discarded. Press Resume to retry the same shape |
| **Resume** | Restart the interrupted shape trial |
| **Confirm Next** | Confirm readiness for the next participant's turn |
| **Stop** | End the session and close the program (confirmation required) |

### Stopping and Restarting

Pressing **Stop** ends the session and closes the application entirely. To start a new session, run `python main.py` again.

---

## Output Data

Each session creates a timestamped directory under the configured output folder:

```
output_base_dir/
|-- MAIN_experiment_monitoring.xlsx              # Cross-session monitoring log
+-- session_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS/
    |-- event_log.csv                            # Timestamped event log (ms precision)
    |-- session_log.xlsx                         # Per-trial Excel summary
    |-- session_config.json                      # Configuration snapshot
    |-- progress.json                            # Crash-recovery checkpoint
    +-- subjects/
        |-- Alice/
        |   |-- rep_1/
        |   |   |-- circle/
        |   |   |   +-- Alice_circle_rep1_shapeRep1_20260214_143045.avi
        |   |   |-- square/
        |   |   |   +-- Alice_square_rep1_shapeRep1_20260214_143112.avi
        |   |   +-- ...
        |   +-- rep_2/
        |       +-- ...
        +-- Bob/
            +-- rep_1/
                |-- circle/
                |   +-- Bob_circle_rep1_shapeRep1_20260214_143230.avi
                +-- ...
```

**Video files:** AVI format with MJPG codec. Filename encodes subject, shape, repetition number, shape instance, and timestamp.

**Event log:** CSV with millisecond-precision timestamps for every experimental event (trial start/end, beep on/off, recording start/stop, instructions).

**Session log:** Excel workbook with one row per trial summarizing subject, shape, repetition, status, and video filename.

**Main Experiment Monitor:** `MAIN_experiment_monitoring.xlsx` is created/appended in the output base directory, logging every session with date, time, participants, shapes, repetitions, camera settings, and completion status.

## Architecture

### Threading Model

```
GUI Thread (PyQt5)              Engine Thread (QThread)
+------------------+           +-------------------------+
|  MainWindow      |           |  ExperimentEngine._run() |
|  ControlPanel    |  signals  |  |-- StimulusWindow      |
|  ProgressPanel   | <-------- |  |-- AudioManager        |
|  QueuePanel      |           |  +-- TrialProtocol       |
|  StimulusMirror  |           |                           |
|  CameraPreview   |           |  Camera Record Thread     |
+------------------+           +-------------------------+
```

- **PsychoPy Window + Audio** are created on the engine thread (OpenGL context is thread-bound)
- **pyqtSignal** bridges engine thread to GUI thread for state changes, progress updates, and stimulus mirror
- **threading.Event** provides pause/confirm blocking between operator and engine
- **Camera** runs its own recording thread with continuous preview grab loop

### Timing Precision

All timing-critical operations use PsychoPy's vsync-locked frame counting:

- `win.callOnFlip(audio.play)` --- audio onset synchronized to exact display refresh
- `for _ in range(n_frames): win.flip()` --- durations determined by display refresh rate, not sleep
- Tone buffers pre-generated at `n_frames * frame_duration` for sample-accurate duration matching
- No `time.sleep()` in any timing-critical code path

---

## Development Mode

Dev Mode allows running the full experiment workflow without Basler hardware:

```bash
python main.py --dev-mode
```

**Differences from Lab Mode:**

| Aspect | Lab Mode | Dev Mode |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Camera | Basler acA1440-220um via pypylon | System webcam via OpenCV |
| Frame rate | Configured (default 500 fps) | Webcam native (typically 30 fps) |
| Frame rate measurement | Manual vsync measurement | Skipped (assumes 60 Hz) |
| pypylon required | Yes | No |
| Recording format | AVI (MJPG) | AVI (MJPG) |

All other functionality (wizard, stimulus timing, audio, data logging, progress tracking) works identically in both modes.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `pypylon` import error | Install Basler Pylon SDK first, then `pip install pypylon` |
| No Basler camera detected | Check USB 3.0 connection; close Pylon Viewer if open |
| PsychoPy import error | Ensure Python 3.11.x (not 3.12+); reinstall with `pip install psychopy` |
| Audio plays through wrong device | Select the correct speaker in the Display & Audio wizard step |
| "Get ready" text stays on screen | Frame rate measurement is running; wait a few seconds for it to complete |
| Webcam not available in Dev Mode | Check that no other application is using the webcam |
| Permission errors on output folder | Choose a folder with write access in the Experiment Settings wizard step |
| Application won't start after crash | Delete `.app_memory/memory.json` to reset saved preferences |
